I am Mohammad Amir Eshraghi, a researcher in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Vision. I am passionate about filling the gaps between deep learning, embodied AI, and robotic systems by contributing to egocentric AI and 3D recognition to develop intelligent robots that address real-world challenges.

Recently, I have been collaborating with researchers at Oregon State University (OSU) to design a transformer-based machine vision system implemented on smartphone and robotic systems, enabling real-time decision-making for agricultural purposes.

Before joining OSU, I earned my M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from the Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST), where I specialized in Digital Electronic Systems and Intelligent Systems and developed innovative AI-based solutions for medical applications, including leukemia and COVID-19 diagnosis systems using computer vision and image processing methods. I have collaborated with esteemed research groups across multiple institutions, contributing to impactful projects in AI for healthcare, and publishing my work in peer-reviewed journals.
